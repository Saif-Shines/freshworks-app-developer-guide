# Preface

## Enter or Exit
Developer time is very costly. As a developer you may not know it but ask your product manager or engineering manager and listen to them. Likewise, we thought to make our intent clear upfront on who would be ideal reader of this guide so that we let developer decide.

- You have broad idea how teams use CRM, ITSM, HRMS and CX software or you might have used one. For example, JIRA, Salesforce, Intercomm, Zendesk or Freshdesk.
- You know web development concepts and apply them using HTML, CSS and Javascript regularly alongside consuming SDKs and APIs.
- Have built any simple full stack web applications and know what components are involved.
- Have been involved in software development lifecycle from building a feautre locally and making it to production.
- Preferably, understands B2B products and development practies.

So, if that sounds resonating to you, having an interest to build an Freshworks app qualifies you are a idea reader.

### Objective

Business software is a serious world. Every 'integration' that gets done costs  and every customisation done requires a lot of effort. Especially, developers of this arena know very well about effort that goes in and deadlines those exist for ever.

We are hoping to build a platform for developers of business software, where they could enjoy doing their job. This guide could be helpful especially if you are new developer on Freshworks platform and trying build some cool apps.

### For Impatient

Being is impatient is not bad. Not at all.

It because of this nature we quick start and learn by writing code some code. Imagine you learnt javascript by building a to-do web app. You apply the what have learnt maybe in next project. In that case, I highly recommend you to go and completely any quick start section in [Freshworks Documentation > AppSDK](https://developers.freshworks.com/documentation) and come back. **Do that Now**.
