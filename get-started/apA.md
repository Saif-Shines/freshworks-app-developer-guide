## Appendix A: Friction, Problems and Promise

We are always trying harder to do well at developer experience that we provide to Freshworks App developers. It's only so recently we started focussing in this arena. As much as we are learning from developers, we are trying hard to advocate product teams to optimise certain decisions from platform and product teams for developers.

As you start your journey as Freshworks App developer, not everything may work out on day 1. There are places in your journey where you'd need to sit back and figure out why something is not working as documented. It can also be documentation itself is not clear enough.

### Friction Log

This is a method with which you can help us improve. As an insider, we know very little to make decisions and imagine what can be improved. So, we took an initiative for some of you who are reading this and want to help us on this journey by sharing their Friction Log.

A Friction Log is simply a google document that you'd keep with yourself until you build your first 1 or 2 apps on Freshworks Developer Platform. While you build apps, you'd be sometimes feel it's awesome, stuck, frustrated and event quit if it weren't your job. Just log and append them to a Friction Log template I'm about to share you. Add a snapshot of it.

[Make a Copy of Friction Log Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBLbtryPLJNqAqI3ocI_FdWehb7v-9fm28BXi-Vw_Vk/edit?usp=sharing) and see the example given to keep appending your experience. Make sure the text highlighting is the important part. Or Hey, [simply report your feedback](https://community.developers.freshworks.com/c/ideas/15).

One you're done logging everything you ever wanted to, attach it and send out an email to devrel@freshworks.com
