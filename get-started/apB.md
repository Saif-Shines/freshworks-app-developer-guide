This guide didn't cover everything. There are only certain aspects those exist to get started. Here  I would like to introduce you to some resources, which are valuable to you to become an independent Freshworks Developer.

### Documentation

At this point of time although Freshworks is a single company, the developer documentations are separated at Product level. Each Freshworks' product has their own use cases to be solved with individual offerings for the developers. For example, one product like Freshchat would need an chatbot to be integrated in the website but there isn't any equivalent of that Freshservice, which is IT service management software.

### Sample Apps

For every feature and product, we want to provide a simple sample that could help picturize and use the sample codes in your projects. We are still working to improve the sample codes even more. You can [watch the progress](https://github.com/freshworks/marketplace-sample-apps/projects/4).

### Tutorials

For someone who has a bit of foundations in the platform, next obvious step would be gain more hands on experience building apps. With this exact intent, we have prepared some step by step guided tutorials for developers.

### Forum

At times, it's highly possible that someone else have faced the problem or use case that you are trying to solve before. Developer forum is one such place where developers would exchange notes and help each other for any queries that you might be having.

### Blog

We frequently build tools and make announcements that may ease app development process or may equip your team with newer opportunities. Make sure you keep an eye out on [Developer Platform Blog](https://medium.com/freshworks-developer-blog).
